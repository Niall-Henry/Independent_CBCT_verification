# Independent_CBCT_verification
This work stems from my MSc in Medical Physics research project 'Independent Verification of Extremity Cone Beam Computed Tomography'.  At the time of writing, literature for independent image quality assessment was constrained to applications in radiotherapy planning, interventional radiology and dental/oral and maxillofacial imaging.  No literature was available for image quality assessment with extremity imaging systems, such as the Planmed Verity extremity scanner.

The code presented was developed over the summer of 2023 and the accompanying technical note is a condensed version of the thesis presented for the MSc project.  This code was developed for use with clincial scan protocols and this may not be appliable to all settings.  

Users are encouraged to adapt the code as necessary, on the condition we are let know it is in use.  The code is presented as is, and cannot be guaranteed to be error free.
